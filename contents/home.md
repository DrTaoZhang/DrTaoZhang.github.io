Dr. Zhang is a data mining engineer at CNPC Kunlun Digital Intelligence Technology Co., Ltd., specializing in AI-driven energy exploration and industrial informatics. Currently engaged in the research project "Data-Knowledge Dual-Driven Logging Re-evaluation Model for Mature Wells," he focuses on developing intelligent solutions for micro-layer delineation, reservoir classification, and large-scale logging model optimization. His recent work extends to RAG systems for large language models(LLM), emphasizing knowledge retrieval and multimodal data integration.
With interdisciplinary expertise spanning data analytics, physics-aware modeling, and industrial system optimization, Dr. Zhang's research addresses critical challenges in precision manufacturing and industrial pattern recognition. His work on multi-source information fusion for spindle accuracy monitoring (vibration-temperature-current data integration) has established correlation models between heterogeneous signal features and geometric precision degradation, enabling real-time compensation strategies to enhance machining accuracy and component lifespan. In tensor decomposition methodologies, he developed hybrid regularization frameworks combining sparse/low-rank constraints and physical prior knowledge, achieving 30-45% noise suppression improvement in 3D printing monitoring and nanoparticle detection compared to conventional approaches.
Dr. Zhang's technical contributions have been implemented in oilfield exploration systems and precision manufacturing processes, demonstrating strong cross-domain adaptability. He maintains active academic engagement as a reviewer for IEEE Access, International Journal of Industrial Engineering, and multiple physics/mathematics conferences. His research philosophy emphasizes the integration of domain knowledge with data-driven techniques, particularly in developing explainable AI architectures for industrial scenarios requiring high robustness and interpretability. Current investigations focus on knowledge graph-enhanced RAG systems and physics-informed neural operators for multi-scale industrial data analysis.
